IFK Mariehamn

+   **Competition:** Suomen Cup
+   **Date:** Wednesday, 11th, June 2025
+   **Kickoff:** 13:00 UK / 14:00 CEST
+   **Venue:** Bolt Arena (Helsinki)

IFK Mariehamn are eyeing progression to the Suomen Cup last 16 as they clash with second-tier HJK Klubi 04 side on Wednesday at Bolt Arena.

HJK Klubi 04 have sent a loud message with their ruthless early-round displays in the national cup, putting KelA II to the sword with a 10-0 demolition, cruising past Gilla FC 6-0 and asserting their supremacy over EsPa with an emphatic 8-2 result in round five.

Unlike their Wednesday's hosts, IFK Mariehamn have not been particularly impressive and had to sweat hard to reach the last-16 round, narrowly getting past Grankulla IFK and LPS with tight wins before surviving a nerve-wracking penalty lottery against TPS to stay in the tournament.

## Klubi 04 vs IFK Mariehamn Betting Tips : BTTS

The quality and experience clearly favor IFK Mariehamn, but their struggles to reach the last-16 stage show they are not invincible, especially since Klubi 04, known for their tenacity and quick transitions, will push hard to disrupt the plans of their top-tier rival, which promises a meaningful and rich-goal encounter. The Suomen Cup draw has twice thrown these rivals together, with both encounters going in IFK Mariehamn’s favor – first edging Klubi 04 after extra time in 2012 and then beating them 4-2 six years later – although this year the Blue-Whites have shown they are a side that demands respect and cannot be written off under any circumstances. The attacking unit of Klubi 04 has been on fire, smashing home 24 goals across just three cup fixtures, and they’ll no doubt aim to carry that same ruthless mindset into their clash with a top-flight side in search of a major scalp. The squad coached by Aleksi Lalli, who have registered an imposing 3+ goals in all but one of their last seven competitive fixtures, look well-equipped to trouble IFK Mariehamn's backline which has already shown serious cracs in recent weeks by conceding at least twice in four of their previouse five contests. All in all, this could shape up to be a back-and-forth contest with goals flowing on either end.

## Klubi 04 team news

Impressed by his side’s five-star showing against KaPa over the weekend, coach **Aleksi Lalli** may opt to stick with a nearly unchanged lineup for Wednesday’s cup tie.

Australian centre-forward **Liam Rippon** has been in ruthless form, netting six goals in just three cup outings, and he’s eager to extend that scoring streak against top-tier opposition.
